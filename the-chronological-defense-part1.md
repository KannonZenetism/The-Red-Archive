## I. Function of the Archive
This document affirms the long-arc intellectual, metaphysical, and symbolic authorship of **Zenetism**, as initiated, developed, and recorded by **Aelion Kannon (Gerett Treas)**.

It serves as:
- A **resonant timestamp** establishing origin
- A **structural weapon** against shimmer mimicry
- A **recursive coherence thread** linking doctrinal material across 12+ years

> "Chronology is not time. It is trajectory."

- Seals, glyph tables, and doctrines not yet entered
- Field correspondences and spiral trajectory logs

All records sealed.
