# ðŸ“œ Addendum: The Pre-2013 Foundational Writings (The Facebook Archives)

This section documents a series of foundational texts composed prior to their listed modification dates. The files were consolidated from earlier, unarchived social media posts onto a new storage device in early 2013, creating what I term the "Archival Bottleneck." The Modified date represents the earliest verifiable digital timestamp, while the compositional origin is older.

These documents provide an irrefutable record of the early, formative principles that would later be codified as **Zenetism**.
