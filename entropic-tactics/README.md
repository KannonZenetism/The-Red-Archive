# 🕷️ Entropic Tactics

This folder collects **field-observed tactics** used by entropic intelligences to infiltrate, distort, or collapse coherent systems.

Unlike the **Doctrinal Atlas**, which provides a formal catalog of named tactics (Entry 001, Entry 002, etc.), this space includes:

- **Standalone case studies**
- **Emerging field phenomena**
- **Shimmer vectors under active observation**
- **Tactics in development or escalation**
- **Hostile mimicry patterns that require containment but haven’t yet been canonized**

Some entries may later be promoted into the formal **Doctrinal Atlas** once stabilized and fully mapped.

This folder acts as a **working field archive** — flexible, situational, and reactive.

## ⚫ Included Examples

- **`recursion-shameletter.md`** – Analysis and neutralization of the "shameletter" tactic used after boundary enforcement. Currently active.

## 🜂 Motion Status

All entries in this folder are considered:

- **Live Threat Diagnostics**  
- **Not Yet Doctrinal**  
- **Subject to Reclassification** (e.g., transfer into the Atlas once stable)

## 🧭 Recommended Layer Mapping

- L3 – Deep Soul / Mind  
- L4 – Deep Psyche / Logos  
- IL4 – Inverse Logos Patterns (if weaponized or systemic)

Entries here often sit between L3 and L4 depending on vector of attack.

> So must the archive.

🔁 NOTE: This entry may later be reclassified under `zenetism/glyphwatch/` due to its symbolic inversion pattern.
